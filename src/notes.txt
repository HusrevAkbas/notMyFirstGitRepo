Day 1:
----
STEP1:Create a project on intelliJ
Open your intelliJ
Click next
Name: my_github_project
----
STEP 2: Crate GitHub Repository
*Repository(git repo) means github project folder. We must create a repository to store project.
* We installed git.
->https://github.com/ and login
* Click on your profile
* Click on Repositories
* Click on New
*Repository Name : my-first-git-repo
* Select public or private
------
STEP 3: Pust the codes to GitHub
* Open intelliJ Terminal
* Then fallow the instruction on github!
	-git init
	Done only once for each project. This is used for the initializing the project. This will create .git folder to store the project versions.
	Note: If you see: The term 'git' is not recognized
	It means github installation is not complated.
	-git add .
	Done after each code change. It adds the codes in staging area.
	-git commit -m "first commit"
	Done after each code change. This is used for creating new version oj the project.
	-git branch -M main
	Done once for each code project.
	-git remote add origin https://github.com/yasinaniltechpro/my-first-git-repo.git
	Done once for each code project.
	-git push -u origin main
	Done once for each code project.

DONE!!!
****Git Push Practice****
After the first push, we do not use some of the commits that we used in the first.
1. Create a new java class under src.
2. Create main method and write code:
public class MyGitClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("I am learning GitHub!!");
    }
}
3. Then push this code to the same repository.
-git add .
-git commit -m "second commit"
-git push
-----------------
How to pull the code from GitHub to local computer
-Create q new file:text_file.txt
-Add some comments:
This is my code!!!
-Commit new file
(Now we created a file in GitHub)
*We will get that code from GitHub to IntelliJ
	** git pull
***USEFULL COMMENDS:
	-git status
	:This is our friend. We can see status of our codes.
	We can use this anytime to see where you are.
